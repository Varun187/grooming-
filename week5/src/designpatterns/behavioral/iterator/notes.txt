iterators allows way to access elements/chidren of an aggregate object in 
sequence while hiding the actual iternal data structure

iterators are stateful,iterator object remembers its position 
while iterating

eg: Iteratorclass in java, Scanner class

pitfall:
access to index during iteration is not readily available like 
we have in a for loop

making modification on collection while iterating make iterator instance
invalid

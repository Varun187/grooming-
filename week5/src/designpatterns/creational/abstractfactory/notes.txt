Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects 
without specifying their concrete classes

when we have multiple set of objects in one set work together then u can 
use abstact factory pattern to isolate the client code from concrete objects 
and their factories

factories can be implemented as singleton, we typically need only one 
instance of it anyway

adding new product type requires changes to base factory as well as 
its implementation

we provide client code with the concrete factory so that it can create objects

abstract factory uses factory method pattern 

if objects are expensive to create we can transparently switch the factory 
implementation to use prototype design pattern to create objects

eg:javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory
javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory
javax.xml.xpath.XPathFactory

pitfalls:
more complex to implement
adding new product type requires changes to base factory as well as 
its implementation
this pattern is specific to problem of product families

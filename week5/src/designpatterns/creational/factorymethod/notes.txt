we want to move the object creation logic from our code to separate class
.We don't need to know in advance the we may need to instantiate

it is done by letting subclasses decide which object to instantiate by 
overriding the factory method

creator hierarchy reflects the product hierarchy

eg: java.util.AbstractCollection has abstact method called iterator

pitfalls
more complex to implement since more classes are involved and need more 
unit test
we have start implement factory method from beginning as it is 
difficult to refactor existing code into factory afterwards
this pattern forces to subclass just to create appropriate instance

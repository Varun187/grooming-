we have a complex process to construct the object involving multiple steps 
then we can use builder pattern

we remove logic related to the object construction from client code 
and abstract it in a separate class

to create a immutable class by implementeing builder as a inner static class

eg: 1. stringbuilder class in java
but it has loop hole . by GOF builder should havepotential to build different
reprensentation of product interface using same steps. 
but stringbuider couldn't

2.builder class in java.util.Calendar.builder

pitfall:
use of method chaining may look complex
possibilty of partially initialized object. in such a case build method 
should provide suitable defaults or throw exception
